      <p class="mystyle" style="height: 150px;overflow:auto;">Nurtured from the seed of a single great idea - to empower the traveller - TripAdvisor went on to pioneer the entire online travel industry in India. TripAdvisor has revolutionised the travel industry over the years. This is the story of TripAdvisor, India’s Online Travel Leader.<br><br>

          TripAdvisor.com, India’s leading online travel company was founded in the year 2000 by Deep Kalra. Created to empower the Indian traveller with instant booking and comprehensive choices, the company began its journey in the US-India travel market. It aimed to offer a range of best-value products and services along with cutting-edge technology and dedicated round-the-clock customer support.<br>

After consolidating its position in the market as a brand recognised for its reliability and transparency, TripAdvisor followed its success in the US by launching its India operations in 2005.

With the foresight to seize the opportunities in the domestic travel market, brought on by a slew of new airlines, TripAdvisor offered travellers the convenience of online travel bookings at rock-bottom prices. Rapidly, TripAdvisor became the preferred choice of millions of travellers who were delighted to be empowered by a few mouse clicks!<br>

TripAdvisor’s rise has been lead by the vision and the spirit of each one of its employees, for whom no idea was too big and no problem too difficult. With untiring innovation and determination, TripAdvisor proactively began to diversify its product offering, adding a variety of online and offline products and services. TripAdvisor also stayed ahead of the curve by continually evolving its technology to meet the ever changing demands of the rapidly developing global travel market.<br>

Steadily establishing itself across India and the world, TripAdvisor simultaneously nurtured the growth of its offline businesses like its franchises and affiliates simultaneously, augmenting the brand’s already strong retail presence further.<br>
